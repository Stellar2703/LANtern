# LANtern 🔦 - Project Story

## Inspiration

The inspiration for **LANtern** came from a common frustration experienced in both home lab environments and enterprise IT settings: the tedious task of manually managing multiple machines across a network. Whether it was walking to different rooms to power on servers for weekend maintenance, or staying late at the office to shut down workstations after hours, the lack of centralized network power management was a constant pain point.

The idea crystallized during a particularly frustrating evening when I had to physically visit several machines in different locations just to restart them after a software update. I thought, *"There has to be a better way to do this remotely."* That's when I discovered Wake-on-LAN (WoL) technology and realized I could build a comprehensive solution that not only wakes machines but also handles shutdown and restart operations through a single, intuitive interface.

The name **LANtern** represents both the illumination of network visibility and the guidance it provides in managing your Local Area Network - like a lantern lighting the way through complex network administration tasks.

## What it does

**LANtern** is a comprehensive network power management system that transforms how you interact with machines across your LAN. Here's what makes it powerful:

### Core Features
- **🖥️ Machine Management**: Add, configure, and organize network machines with detailed network information
- **⚡ Remote Power Control**: Wake machines using Wake-on-LAN, shutdown, and restart operations
- **🏢 Cluster Management**: Group machines into logical clusters for bulk operations
- **📊 Real-time Status Monitoring**: Live ping verification and machine status tracking
- **🔐 Secure Operations**: Encrypted credential storage and authenticated remote operations
- **📱 Modern Interface**: Responsive React-based UI with smooth animations and intuitive design

### User Experience
The application provides a clean, dashboard-style interface where users can:
- View all machines in a comprehensive table with real-time status indicators
- Perform individual or bulk operations with simple button clicks
- Create and manage machine clusters for organizational efficiency
- Monitor power events and track system activity
- Add new machines through guided modal dialogs

## How we built it

### Architecture & Technology Stack

**Frontend (React 19.1.0)**
- **React Router** for seamless single-page application navigation
- **React Bootstrap** for responsive, professional UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** for modern utility-first styling and animations
- **Axios** for robust API communication with the backend
- **FontAwesome** for consistent iconography throughout the interface

**Backend (Express.js 5.1.0)**
- **Express.js** as the foundation for RESTful API development
- **MySQL2** for reliable database connectivity and data persistence
- **Wake-on-LAN (wol)** library for network wake functionality
- **bcrypt** for secure password encryption and authentication
- **CORS** for secure cross-origin resource sharing
- **dotenv** for environment-based configuration management

### Development Process

1. **Database Design**: Started with a robust MySQL schema supporting machines, clusters, and audit logging
2. **API Architecture**: Built RESTful endpoints for all CRUD operations and power management functions
3. **Frontend Components**: Developed reusable React components with Bootstrap styling
4. **Network Integration**: Implemented Wake-on-LAN and remote shutdown capabilities
5. **User Experience**: Added real-time status monitoring, animations, and responsive design
6. **Security Implementation**: Integrated password encryption and secure credential management

### Technical Implementation Highlights

```javascript
// Wake-on-LAN Implementation
const wakeMachine = async (macAddress, broadcastAddress) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        wol.wake(macAddress, { address: broadcastAddress }, (error) => {
            if (error) {
                reject(error);
            } else {
                resolve();
            }
        });
    });
};

// Real-time Status Monitoring
const verifyMachineStatus = async (machine) => {
    const response = await axios.post(`${API_BASE_URL}/machines/${machine.id}/ping`);
    const isOnline = response.data.isOnline;
    // Update UI with real-time status
};
```

## Challenges we ran into

### 1. **Network Protocol Complexity**
Understanding and implementing Wake-on-LAN proved more complex than initially anticipated. The protocol requires specific network configurations, broadcast addresses, and magic packet formatting. Debugging network-level issues required deep diving into subnet calculations and broadcast domain understanding.

### 2. **Cross-Platform Remote Operations**
Implementing remote shutdown and restart commands across different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) required platform-specific command variations and error handling strategies. Windows systems needed special authentication handling through SMB protocols.

### 3. **Real-time Status Management**
Creating reliable real-time machine status monitoring without overwhelming the network with ping requests required implementing intelligent polling intervals and caching mechanisms. Balancing accuracy with network efficiency was challenging.

### 4. **Security Considerations**
Storing and transmitting machine credentials securely while maintaining usability required careful implementation of encryption, secure API endpoints, and proper authentication flows.

### 5. **State Management Complexity**
Managing complex application state across multiple React components (machines, clusters, modals, alerts) while maintaining data consistency and user experience required careful component design and state lifting strategies.

### 6. **Database Schema Evolution**
Designing a flexible database schema that could accommodate future features while maintaining referential integrity between machines, clusters, and audit logs required multiple iterations and careful planning.
