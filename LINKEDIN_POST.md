# 🔦 LANtern: Revolutionizing Network Management - My Latest Project! 

🚀 **Ever got tired of walking around to manually power on/off machines in your network?** I sure did! 

That's why I built **LANtern** - a comprehensive web-based network power management system that lets you control ANY machine on your LAN with just one click! 💻✨

## 🎯 What LANtern Does:
🖥️ **Remote Power Control** - Wake, shutdown, restart machines instantly  
📊 **Real-time Monitoring** - Live status tracking with ping verification  
🏢 **Cluster Management** - Bulk operations for multiple machines  
🔐 **Secure Operations** - Encrypted credentials and authenticated access  
📱 **Modern UI** - Beautiful, responsive React interface  

## 🛠️ Built With:
⚛️ **Frontend**: React 19.1, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS  
🚀 **Backend**: Express.js, MySQL, Wake-on-LAN  
🔒 **Security**: bcrypt encryption, CORS protection  
📡 **Network**: WoL magic packets, remote shutdown protocols  

## 💡 The Problem I Solved:
❌ No more walking to different rooms for server maintenance  
❌ No more staying late to manually shut down workstations  
❌ No more complex command-line network management  
✅ **One dashboard to rule them all!**

## 🎉 Key Achievements:

⚛️ Advanced React state management and component architecture  
🗄️ Database design for complex relational data  
🔐 Security best practices for credential management
